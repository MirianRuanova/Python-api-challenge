## Background
What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

# Part 1: WeatherPy

In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks, the OpenWeatherMap APILinks, and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, I used the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook. T

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
